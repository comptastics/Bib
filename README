Welcome to John's bibliography file (begun from a seed of Rob Schapire
and Yoram Singer). Please be gentle when making changes to the
bibliography file, as it has been built for about 12 years by hand,
and it only takes a few tweaks to make it less useful.

This bib.bib file is very convenient, as you can simply soft-link it
into whatever project you are working on, and then you do not have to
maintain multiple bibliography files. The aggressively precise
formatting also means that citations are simpler within the file, and
easier to find. As a corollary to this, please *use* this bib file--it
is convenient! Do not start your own ones!

*** Entry format ***

Entries are in alphabetical order by first author's last name, and
each has a key given by first author's full last name, then first two
initials of each additional author, followed by the 2-digit year.
As a typical example, here is

@article{DuchiBaWa12,
author = {John C. Duchi and Peter L. Bartlett and Martin J. Wainwright},
title = {Randomized Smoothing for Stochastic Optimization},
year = 2012,
journal = siopt,
volume = 22,
number = 2,
pages = {674--701},
}

Note that this has an abbreviated journal. This is because there are
strings at the top of the file to allow consistent formatting. Please use those
whenever possible; e.g., NIPS should be

booktitle = nips2013

where the last four digits indicate which year of NIPS it is.

*** Formatting instructions ***

When entering things from the arXiv, use the format

@article{DuchiGlNa16,
  title={Statistics of Robust Optimization: A Generalized Empirical
    Likelihood Approach},
  author={John C. Duchi and Peter W. Glynn and Hongseok Namkoong},
  year=2016,
  journal={arXiv:1610.03425 [stat.ML]},
}

Note that you should *never* use

journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.03425}

as that does not actually reflect arXiv's desired citation style. You
should include the subject area.  Relatedly, do not simply download
Google's citations, as they are typically wrong and have bad capitalization,
etc.

*** Comments and Common Errors ***

In the title field, any letters that should be capitalized must be
surrounded by brackets, i.e.

title = {Some cool things called {M}arkov chains}

rather than

title = {Some cool things called Markov chains}

as latex will lower-case Markov in the second example.
